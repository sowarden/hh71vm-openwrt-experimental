# HH71VM delta for OpenWrt 19.07

This directory contains the target, package overlays, patches, vendor driver ports, and
captured build configuration used for the published HH71VM RAM image. It is applied on top
of a pinned OpenWrt checkout; it is not a standalone source tree.

Use the repository-level [source and build guide](../docs/sources.md) for exact revisions,
commands, artifact hashes, provenance, and the current clean-rebuild limitation.

## Verified hardware configuration

- RTL8197FS SoC, MIPS 24Kc, 128 MiB RAM;
- external gigabit PHY on switch port 0, MDIO address 6;
- SoC 2.4 GHz radio with `SOC_RFE_TYPE_1`;
- PCIe RTL8812FE 5 GHz radio in slot 0 with `SLOT_0_RFE_TYPE_0`;
- Qualcomm connection through the GPIO24 USB mux and RNDIS `eth2`;
- SPI-NOR `w25q128` through the `spi-sheipa` controller.

These values were verified on one HH71VM. They must be treated as board-specific until
reports from other revisions prove otherwise.

## Public release boundary

The repository publishes only the prebuilt `*-nfjrom.bin` RAM image. This source directory
also contains ongoing flash-support code because it is part of the same port, but prebuilt
flash images, flash tools, and public installation instructions are intentionally withheld.

Do not present the vendor Ethernet or Wi-Fi trees as generic drop-in Linux drivers. Their
current integration depends on the RTL8197F BSP, Linux 4.14, Realtek SDK interfaces, board
RFE selections, DMA exports, and HH71VM-specific userspace setup.
